# AutoValue: Redacted Extension

An extension for Google's [AutoValue](https://github.com/google/auto/tree/master/value) that omits
`@Redacted` field values from `toString()`.


## Usage

Include the extension in your project, define a `@Redacted` annotation, and apply it to any
fields that you wish to redact.

```java
@Retention(SOURCE)
@Target({METHOD, PARAMETER, FIELD})
public @interface Redacted {
}
```

```java
@AutoValue
public abstract class User {
  public abstract String name();
  @Redacted public abstract String phoneNumber();
}
```

When you call `toString()` any `@Redacted` properties are hidden:
```
User{name=Bob, phoneNumber=██}
```


## Download

Add a Gradle dependency:

```groovy
apt 'com.squareup.auto.value:auto-value-redacted:1.0.0'
```
(Using the [android-apt][apt] plugin)

or Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.squareup.auto.value</groupId>
  <artifactId>auto-value-redacted</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

Snapshots of the development version are available in [Sonatype's `snapshots` repository][snap].
